<h1 id="What-are-the-21-worst-words-to-use-in-a-job-post"><a href="#What-are-the-21-worst-words-to-use-in-a-job-post" class="headerlink" title="What are the 21 worst words to use in a job post?"></a>What are the 21 worst words to use in a job post?</h1><p>When you’re looking for a job, it’s important to use the right words in your job post. You want to make sure that you attract the best candidates, and using the wrong words can do just the opposite.</p>
<p>Here are 21 of the worst words to use in a job post:</p>
<ol>
<li>“Entry level”</li>
</ol>
<p>When you use the term “entry level,” you’re immediately telling potential candidates that they don’t meet your requirements. Candidates want to feel valued, so avoid using this term.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>“No experience necessary”</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t require experience, why are you even requiring a resume? This is another phrase that will make candidates feel like they don’t meet your requirements.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>“Recent graduate”</li>
</ol>
<p>This term tells candidates that you only want recent graduates, which eliminates anyone who has been out of school for a while. Try using phrases like “recent college graduate” or “new grads welcome.”</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>“Must be currently unemployed”</li>
</ol>
<p>This phrase screams “Only desperate people need apply!” It also implies that you think unemployment is a bad thing. Instead, try saying something like “must be available to start work immediately.”</p>
<h1 id="Is-it-better-to-use-positive-or-negative-words-in-a-job-post"><a href="#Is-it-better-to-use-positive-or-negative-words-in-a-job-post" class="headerlink" title="Is it better to use positive or negative words in a job post?"></a>Is it better to use positive or negative words in a job post?</h1><p>There is a lot of debate surrounding the use of positive or negative words when writing a job post. Some people believe that using negative words will help to filter out unqualified candidates, while others believe that using positive words will make your company seem more desirable. So, which is better?</p>
<p>The answer to this question depends on a few factors. First, you need to consider your goals for the job post. Are you looking to attract a large number of qualified candidates, or are you looking to specifically target candidates who are a good fit for your company? If you are looking for a large number of qualified candidates, then it might be better to use negative words to help weed out unqualified applicants. However, if you are looking for candidates who are a good fit for your company, then you should use positive words to attract them.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is the industry in which you are recruiting. Some industries are more competitive than others, and using positive words may not be enough to attract candidates. In these cases, it might be necessary to use negative words in order to highlight the fact that the position is competitive and only the best candidates will be considered.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer when it comes to using positive or negative words in a job post. It depends on your goals and the industry in which you are recruiting. However, it is important to carefully consider how you want to portray your company and what kind of candidates you are hoping to attract.</p>

However, there are some general rules that apply regardless of the position.</p>
<p>When advertising a management-level position, it is important to highlight the skills and experience that qualify the applicant for the job. Use words like “leadership,” “strategy” and “problem-solving” to show that the applicant has what it takes to manage a team or department.</p>
<p>For lower-level positions, employers may want to focus on the specific tasks that will be carried out by the new employee. Use words like “detail-oriented” and “organized” to show that the applicant has the necessary skills for the job.</p>
<p>It is also important to avoid using clichés in job postings. Words like “hardworking” and “dependable” may sound like they are describing all applicants, so it is better to be specific about what you are looking for.</p>
<p>In general, it is best to use concrete terms rather than adjectives or adverbs when describing a position. For example, instead of saying that you are looking for a “creative individual,” say that you need someone who can design marketing materials. This will help filter out candidates who may not have the required skills.</p>

<p>First, be clear about the qualifications you are looking for. List the specific skills and experience required for the position.</p>
<p>Second, make sure your job post is accurate and up-to-date. It’s important to be honest about the role and what it entails. Don’t make promises you can’t keep.</p>
<p>Third, use the right words to describe your company and the position. Use words that inspire confidence and make potential candidates want to learn more.</p>
<p>Finally, be selective about who you choose to share your job post with. Make sure you target the right audience and avoid spamming people who aren’t likely to be interested in the position.</p>
