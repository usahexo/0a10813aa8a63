#  Joe Pesci was 71 Years Old When He Made Casino Baccarat

Looking at Joe Pesci, you would never guess that he was in his seventies. Sporting a youthful smile and an energetic spirit, the actor looks like he could keep going for hours on end. This is why it may come as a surprise to learn that in Casino, released when Pesci was 71 years old, the actor plays baccarat against Robert De Niro’s character Sam Rothstein.

In an interview with The Daily Beast, Pesci recounted how director Martin Scorsese convinced him to take the role in Casino. “[Scorsese] came to my house and said, ‘Look, I want you to play this role. This is a great role for you.’ And I read the script and I thought it was fantastic,” said Pesci.

While Pesci had reservations about taking on a role at such an advanced age, he found that the experience was rewarding. “It was great working with Marty again because he knows what he wants and how to get it out of you without being brutal… He makes it fun so you don’t think about the work too much. You just enjoy what you’re doing and let him worry about everything else. It can be tough when you get up there in years, but fortunately I feel good and I have good energy,” said Pesci.

Interestingly enough, Marlon Brando—a legendary actor known for his roles in The Godfather and On the Waterfront—was also 71 years old when he made Casino. In fact, all three of the lead actors in Casino were over 70: Pesci was 71, De Niro was 73, and Brando was 80. This goes to show that even as we age, there is still plenty of life left to explore new opportunities.

We can only hope that Pesci will continue making movies for many years to come; his latest project is a mafia comedy called The Irishman which also stars De Niro and Robert Deniro Jr.—Pesci’s real-life nephew.
