#  Australia To Tighten Laws On Online Gambling

Australia's new online gambling laws will come into effect on September 1, and will make it much harder for operators to offer services to Australians.

The new laws will require all Australian-facing gambling operators to hold a license from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), and will prohibit any unlicensed operator from offering their services to Australians.

This move is expected to significantly reduce the number of online gambling operators offering their services to Australians, as the cost and complexity of obtaining an ACMA license is likely to be prohibitive for many operators.

While this may be bad news for Australian players, it is good news for the remaining licensed operators, who can now be assured that they have a monopoly on the Australian market.

The ACMA has been given a range of enforcement powers under the new laws, including the power to issue infringement notices and civil penalties, and has promised to take a tough stance against those operators who try to flout the law.

#  Australia Moves To Ban Online Gambling

The Australian government has this week announced a ban on all online gambling, in a bid to protect consumers and stamp out illegal activity.

The new legislation will come into effect later this year, making it illegal for any company or individual to offer online gambling services to Australians. This includes both domestic and international operators, as well as interactive gaming services offered by Australian bookmakers.

“This is a significant day for Australian consumers, who will now be better protected from the risk of engaging in illegal online gambling activities,” said the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Kelly O’Dwyer.

“Illegal offshore operators do not have the same consumer protections as licensed Australian providers and often do not meet our strict regulatory requirements. This includes requirements relating to protecting consumers from harm, providing responsible gambling tools and displaying information about the risks of gambling.”

O’Dwyer added that the ban would also help to protect the integrity of Australia’s regulated gambling market, which is worth an estimated A$24 billion each year.

The prohibition on online gambling will apply to all forms of gambling, including poker, blackjack and sports betting. However, it will not apply to lotteries or state-run sports pools.

The news has been welcomed by the country’s major bookmakers, who have long lobbied for stronger regulation of the online gambling market.

“We are pleased that the government has recognised the need for a ban on illegal offshore wagering and we look forward to working with them on implementation,” said CEO of William Hill Australia James Henderson.

Opposition parties have raised concerns that the new laws could lead to increased consumer protection risks, but the government is confident that adequate measures are in place to safeguard players.

#  Australia Plans To Regulate Online Gambling

The Australian government has announced plans to regulate the country’s online gambling industry. The new rules are set to come into effect in early 2019 and will place a number of restrictions on how online casinos can operate.

Under the new regulations, online casinos will be required to obtain a license from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). They will also be banned from offering “unfettered access” to their games, meaning players will have to make a deposit before they can start playing.

Other restrictions include a ban on online casino operators marketing their products to Australians, and a limit on the amount of money that can be deposited into an account each day. Online casinos will also be prohibited from offering sign-up bonuses or other incentives to lure new customers.

Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison defended the new regulations, saying they were needed to protect consumers. “These reforms provide greater protections for Australian consumers, including banning unlicensed offshore operators from targeting Australians and limiting the amount of money Australians can lose each day,” he said.

Opposition spokesman for consumer affairs Craig Laundy welcomed the move but said more needed to be done to protect consumers. “While this is a good step forward, we still need better consumer protection measures including stronger penalties for those caught contravening the law and independent dispute resolution processes for gamers who feel they have been ripped off,” he said.

The new regulations come after a review of the online gambling industry by the Department of Social Services found that around 80 percent of online casinos are unregulated and pose a risk to consumers.

#  New Laws Proposed For Online Gambling In Australia

The Australian government is planning to introduce new laws regulating online gambling. The proposed legislation would require online gambling operators to obtain a license from the government in order to offer their services to Australian customers.

The new laws are aimed at protecting Australian consumers and ensuring that online gambling operators comply with Australian law. Under the proposed legislation, online gambling operators would be required to clearly display information about responsible gambling practices on their websites. They would also be forbidden from offering credit to customers for gambling purposes.

In addition, the Australian government is planning to introduce a new levy on online gambling operators in order to raise money for problem gambling treatment and research. This levy will be in addition to the existing taxes that online gambling operators currently pay in Australia.

The proposed legislation has been welcomed by anti-gambling advocates, who have long argued that the regulation of online gambling is needed in order to protect consumers. However, the proposed laws have been met with criticism by the online gambling industry, which argues that they will lead to higher costs and reduced competition.

#  Australian Government Announces Changes To Laws On Online Gambling


The Australian government has announced a number of changes to the laws on online gambling, which come into effect on 15 September 2017. The changes are designed to provide greater protections for consumers and improve the integrity of the gambling sector.

Under the new laws, online casinos will be required to obtain an Australian licence in order to offer their services to the local market. In addition, operators will be required to ensure that players are using their own funds when gambling, and not using borrowed or stolen money.

Players will also be able to set personal spending limits to help them manage their gambling habits. These limits can be applied across all forms of gambling, or specific to one type of gambling activity. Players will also be able to self-exclude from all online casinos if they feel they need to take a break from gambling.

The government has also announced a new "blacklist" of unlicensed online casinos that will be prohibited from offering services in Australia. This list will be maintained by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) and updated regularly.

These changes are part of a broader package of reforms that the government is undertaking to improve consumer protections in the online gambling sector. Other measures include improved information sharing between gambling providers and agencies such as AUSTRAC, as well as enhanced consumer education initiatives.

The government says that these changes are necessary to crack down on illegal activities and protect consumers from unscrupulous operators.
