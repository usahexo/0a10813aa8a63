#  Shaq Caught on Camera Destroying Casino Chips During Mini-Riot in Vegas 

Former NBA sensation and current professional boxer Shaquille O’Neal was recently caught on camera smashing casino chips during a mini-riot at the craps table in Las Vegas. The footage, which has since gone viral, shows Shaq becoming increasingly agitated as he loses money at the table before finally flipping over the entire table and destroying millions of dollars worth of chips.

According to witnesses, Shaq had been drinking heavily and began arguing with other players at the table after becoming frustrated with his losses. He then picked up a pile of chips and threw them across the room, before overturning the table and launching the remaining chips into the air. Security soon arrived on the scene to break up the altercation, but not before Shaq had caused significant damage.

The incident is just the latest in a long line of public meltdowns for Shaq, who has been embroiled in several high-profile scandals throughout his career. In 2009 he was arrested for driving under the influence, and in 2012 he was caught using a fake ID at a casino in Massachusetts. This latest debacle is sure to add to his tarnished image and could potentially have repercussions for his career as a boxer.

It remains to be seen what consequences Shaq will face for his actions in Las Vegas, but one thing is for sure – he won’t be winning any awards for behaviour this time round!

#  How Shaq is Living Down Tried to Rip Down Casino Chips During a Mini Riot in Vegas 

It was early Monday morning when former NBA great Shaquille O'Neal decided to have a little too much fun inside the casino of the Wynn Las Vegas Resort. Shaq, who was in Sin City for an upcoming DJ gig according to witnesses, got into an altercation with security guards that quickly escalated. 

O'Neal and about 10 friends were initially turned away from the blackjack tables by casino personnel because they were reportedly too rowdy. Shaq didn't take kindly to the rejection and began berating security guards, who called for backup. That's when things turned chaotic. According to one witness, "Shaq started picking up chips off the table and throwing them across the room." 

The former Laker then allegedly attempted to rip down several thousand-dollar chips from a nearby craps table before being apprehended by security and escorted from the premises. No arrests were made and it's unknown if Shaq will face any penalties from Wynn Las Vegas Resort. 

In a statement released to the media, a spokesperson for Wynn said, "This incident did not rise to the level of trespass or physical aggression and we are confident that it will have no impact on our future relationship with Mr. O'Neal." 

For his part, Shaq took to Twitter to apologize for his behavior writing, "I love vegas... I over reacted last night and I apologize... It was wrong for me to go in there..." O'Neal is no stranger to controversy having been involved in several high-profile run-ins with law enforcement throughout his career.

#  Shaq's Recent Behavior Raising Questions About His Mental State 

It is no secret that Shaquille O'Neal has had a complicated relationship with mental health throughout his life. He has discussed his struggles with bipolar disorder in the past and has even alluded to suicidal thoughts. However, in recent months, Shaq's behavior has become increasingly erratic and worrying, raising questions about the state of his mental health.

For example, in July, Shaq was filmed dancing naked on top of a car in the middle of a Florida street. In September, he was kicked off an airplane after allegedly becoming disruptive and arguing with staff members. Most recently, in November, he was arrested for battery after getting into a physical altercation with his girlfriend.

These incidents have many people concerned about Shaq's well-being and wondering if he is currently dealing with a mental health issue. While it is impossible to know for sure what is going on in Shaq's mind, these behaviors are certainly concerning and suggest that he may need help.

If you are concerned about someone you know who may be struggling with mental health issues, it is important to reach out to them and offer your support. You can encourage them to seek professional help if necessary and offer to accompany them to their appointments or therapy sessions. It is also important to stay positive and supportive, even during tough times. Mental health can be difficult to deal with, but there is always hope for recovery.

#  Shameful: Shaq caught on camera destroying casino chips during mini riot in Vegas 

In a video that has now gone viral, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal is seen in the middle of a mini riot at a Las Vegas casino, destroying casino chips and generally causing mayhem. The former basketball superstar was in town for an exhibition game at the T-Mobile Arena as part of the Big3 league when the incident occurred.

Shaq can be seen in the video berating casino staff and security, before picking up handfuls of chips and throwing them across the room. He also appears to push over at least one machine. The former Laker was eventually escorted from the casino by security and Las Vegas Metro PD arrived on the scene to investigate.

It's not clear what sparked Shaq's outburst, but it's certainly not the first time the big man has been involved in controversy. In 2010 he was arrested for assault after getting into a fight with then-Cleveland Cavaliers center Jermaine O'Neal. And in 2000 he was sued by a woman who claimed she was raped by Shaq and two of his friends. The case was eventually settled out of court.

This latest incident is sure to bring more negative attention to Shaq, who has often been criticized for his poor behavior both on and off the court. It's a sad end to what was once an impressive career, and it will be interesting to see how Shaq responds now that he's been caught on camera in such an embarrassing display.

#  Shaq's questionable behavior continues as he is caught on camera destroying casino chips during mini riot in Vegas

Shaquille O'Neal is no stranger to controversy. The retired basketball player has been in the news more times than fans would like for his off-the-court antics. Most recently, he was caught on camera participating in a mini riot at the casino where he was staying in Las Vegas.

In a video posted to social media, Shaq can be seen smashing casino chips and yelling while several people appear to be trying to restrain him. The cause of the outburst is not clear, but it's just the latest in a long line of questionable behavior from the former NBA star.

In 2016, Shaq was accused of sexual assault by an employee of an Atlanta hotel where he was hosting an event. The woman later withdrew her allegations, but Shaq still faced a lawsuit from the hotel over the incident.

That same year, he was pulled over for driving under the influence and subsequently arrested. Shaq later plead no contest to the charges and was sentenced to community service and probation.

These incidents are just a small sample of Shaq's troubled past. He has been involved in numerous other lawsuits and has had several run-ins with the law. Clearly, Shaq has some anger issues that need to be addressed.

It's sad that such a talented athlete has chosen to squander his talent and reputation with such childish behavior. Shaq is clearly capable of much better and needs to get his act together before it's too late.
