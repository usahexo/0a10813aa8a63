#  What are the requirements for a business to reopen in Myanmar?

There are a few things that businesses need in order to reopen in Myanmar. The most important thing is that the business must be registered with the Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA). The other necessary requirements depend on the sector in which the business operates. 

For a business to be registered with DICA, it must have at least one local partner who is a Myanmar citizen and has at least a 51% ownership stake in the company. In some cases, additional requirements may be imposed by the relevant ministry or department. For instance, in order to operate as a bank or financial institution in Myanmar, an applicant must satisfy additional criteria set by the Central Bank of Myanmar.

Aside from registration with DICA, businesses must also comply with relevant licensing and permit requirements. For example, if a business intends to sell goods or services, it must apply for a trade license from the Ministry of Commerce. And if it intends to hire foreign employees, it must apply for an approval letter from the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population. 

The process of reopening a business in Myanmar can be time-consuming and complicated. It is advisable to seek legal assistance from an experienced law firm in order to ensure compliance with all applicable requirements.

#  How long will it take for businesses to reopen in Myanmar?

When Cyclone Nargis made landfall in Myanmar on May 2, 2008, it left a path of destruction in its wake. The cyclone killed an estimated 138,000 people and left 1.5 million homeless. In the aftermath of the cyclone, businesses throughout Myanmar were shut down as the country tried to come to grips with the devastation. But how long did it take for businesses to reopen in Myanmar?

While there is no definitive answer, it appears that it took businesses several months to reopened in most parts of the country. For example, a report from June 2009 indicated that many businesses in Yangon were still closed, although some had started to reopen. In fact, some business owners were reluctant to reopen due to concerns about security and the unstable political situation in the country.

It took until September 2009 for the government of Myanmar to pass a new business law, which aimed to make it easier for businesses to operate. The new law exempted businesses from certain licensing requirements and made it easier for them to get credit. This helped pave the way for a resumption of business activity throughout the country.

However, it should be noted that not all parts of Myanmar saw a quick resumption of business activity following the cyclone. For example, in Rakhine State – which was hit particularly hard by the cyclone – many businesses remained closed well into 2010. This was due in part to the fact that Rakhine State was already struggling economically prior to the cyclone and was considered one of the poorest states in Myanmar.

Overall, it appears that it took several months for businesses throughout most of Myanmar to reopen after Cyclone Nargis struck. While there were some exceptions, especially in areas that were already struggling economically, most parts of the country slowly started to resume normal business activity several months after the storm hit.

#  What is the government doing to help businesses reopen in Myanmar?

The current government in Myanmar is doing a lot to help businesses reopen and get back on their feet after years of economic sanctions. A big focus has been placed on improving infrastructure and creating a more business-friendly environment.

One example is the new Special Economic Zones (SEZs), which offer concessions and incentives to companies that set up shop there. These zones have been set up in strategic locations around the country, making it easier for businesses to reach new markets.

Myanmar also boasts one of the lowest corporate tax rates in Southeast Asia, at just 25%. This makes it an attractive destination for foreign investors. In addition, the government is working to streamline the process for obtaining permits and licenses.

All these measures are helping to revive Myanmar’s economy, which is now growing at an annual rate of over 7%. This is good news for businesses, which are seeing increased demand for their products and services.

#  Who is responsible for issuing permits for businesses to reopen in Myanmar?

The process for reopening a business in Myanmar can be complicated. There are many different government agencies that are involved in the process, depending on the type of business and its location. 

One of the most important agencies for issuing permits to businesses is the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC). The MIC is responsible for reviewing and approving investment proposals from both foreign and local investors. 

To get approval from the MIC, businesses must complete an application form and provide detailed information about their proposed investment. In addition, they must also submit a business plan, financial statements, and other supporting documents. 

The authorities in charge of issuing permits for businesses to reopen will also likely want to inspect the proposed business premises to make sure they meet all safety and zoning requirements. 

It can take several months for the MIC to review and approve an application, so it is important to start the process well in advance if you hope to have your business reopened by a specific date.

#  How can businesses apply for permits to reopen in Myanmar?

The process for businesses to apply for permits to reopen in Myanmar can be challenging, but it is worth it to reap the benefits of this growing economy. To start the process, businesses should first research the laws and regulations that are specific to their industry.

Once they have a clear understanding of the requirements, they can then start assembling the necessary application documents. These documents can include copies of company registration certificates, proof of capital, feasibility studies or business plans, resumes and CVs of key personnel, and letters of recommendation from reputable sources.

Businesses should also be aware of the various fees that are associated with the permit application process. For example, there is a processing fee for each application as well as a renewal fee. In addition, businesses may be required to pay bribes in order to expedite the application process.

Despite the challenges, there are many reasons why businesses should consider reopening in Myanmar. The country has a population of over 50 million people and a growing middle class. It is also one of the most opening economies in the world, with a 63% increase in foreign investment between FY 2015-16 and FY 2016-17.

Additionally, Myanmar has many natural resources and a low cost of doing business. The country’s infrastructure is also rapidly improving, with new airports and seaports being constructed. Finally, English is widely spoken in Myanmar making communication easier than in some other Asian countries.
