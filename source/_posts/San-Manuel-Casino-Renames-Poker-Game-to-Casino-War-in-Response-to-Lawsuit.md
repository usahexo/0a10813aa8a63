#  San Manuel Casino Renames Poker Game to Casino War in Response to Lawsuit

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians has renamed its poker game to Casino War in response to a lawsuit filed by the owners of the World Series of Poker.

The name change is an effort by the tribe to avoid any potential legal issues with the World Series of Poker, which claims that Casino War infringes on its trademarks.

"Casino War is a centuries-old game that has been played in casinos all over the world," said San Manuel spokesperson Tom Shields. "We are confident that we will be able to defend our rights to this game."

While the World Series of Poker has not yet commented on the name change, it is possible that they will file a new lawsuit against the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians.

#  San Manuel Casino Drops Poker from Name of Popular Game

The San Manuel Casino in Highland, California has announced that they will no longer be using the name "Poker" when referring to their popular casino game. The announcement comes as a response to new legislation in the state of California that would legalize online poker within the borders of the Golden State.

San Manuel officials say that they don't want to be seen as promoting online poker and that the rebranding is simply an effort to stay in line with regulations. "We don't want to be promoting anything illegal," said San Manuel spokesperson Doug Elmets.

The change will take effect on January 1, 2018, and all references to "Poker" will be replaced with the term "Casino Poker." This includes signage, menus, and all marketing materials.

San Manuel isn't the only casino making changes in anticipation of legalized online poker in California. Last month, the Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, Illinois announced that they would be rebranding their poker room as "Rivers Online Poker."

#  San Manuel Casino Removes Poker from Table Games Menu

The San Manuel Casino in Highland, California has removed poker from its table games menu, effective immediately. The casino said that the decision was made to “better align our table games offerings with customer preferences”.

The poker room at San Manuel Casino is still open for business, and players can still enjoy all of the other table games that are available, including blackjack, roulette and craps. However, the absence of poker from the table games menu is sure to be a disappointment for many of the casino’s regular players.

It’s not clear exactly why San Manuel Casino has decided to remove poker from its table games menu. It could be that the casino is struggling to attract players to its poker room, or it could simply be that there is more demand for other table games. Whatever the reason may be, it’s clear that this move is going to have a negative impact on the poker community in Southern California.

San Manuel Casino is just one of several casinos in California that have decided to discontinue their poker rooms in recent months. Earlier this year, both the Soboba Casino and Morongo Casino Resort & Spa both removed their poker rooms, while the Pechanga Resort & Casino announced plans to close its poker room later this year.

These closures are likely a result of increased competition from online gaming sites such as PokerStars and 888poker. These sites offer players the opportunity to play against opponents from all over the world, and they don’t have to leave their homes to do so. This has resulted in a decline in popularity for live poker rooms in California, and it seems likely that more closures will follow in the coming months.

#  San Manuel Casino to Remove Poker from Table Games Menu

On Tuesday, San Manuel Casino announced that their poker room would be closing permanently on January 7th. The casino cited a "decline in popularity of poker" as the reason for the closure.

Poker has been a mainstay of casino table games for centuries, but its popularity has been waning in recent years. In an effort to appeal to a wider range of customers, San Manuel Casino has decided to remove poker from their table games menu.

The decision was not without controversy. Some poker players feel that the casino is catering to newer and less experienced players who are more likely to gamble away their money. Others believe that the casino is simply responding to market demands and that poker is no longer as popular as it once was.

Whatever the reasons behind the decision, it is clear that San Manuel Casino is no longer interested in offering poker as a mainstay of their table games menu.

#  San Manuel Casino to Remove Poker from Name of Popular Game

The San Manuel Band of Mission Indians is planning to remove Poker from the name of its popular casino game, as well as drop the word "casino" from its website and marketing materials.

The tribe owns and operates San Manuel Casino, one of the largest in California. But it will now call the game "card match" or "match five" to dissociate it from gambling.

Poker is a widely-played card game with many variations. The San Manuel tribe's decision comes amid intensifying competition from Indian casinos and card rooms in California.

Gambling critics have targeted poker in particular, saying that it's particularly addictive and prone to cheating. Tribal leaders say they're making the change to reflect their commitment to responsible gaming.

"We want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to provide our guests with the best possible gaming experience while also promoting responsible gaming," said San Manuel Casino spokeswoman Arlene Magdaleno in a statement.
