Iraqi YouTubers are making a fortune from slots, with some earning more than $2 million a year from the games.

One of the most successful Iraqi YouTubers is Ahmed Al-Rubaie, who has made over $2 million since he started uploading videos about slots in 2016.

Al-Rubaie’s channel has more than 460,000 subscribers and his videos have been viewed more than 190 million times. In one video, he managed to earn a commission of $62,000 from a single casino.

Other Iraqi YouTubers are also doing well from slots. Humam Hammoudi and Hussain Al Rubaei both make over $1 million a year from the games, while Wassim al-Tai has earned over $600,000 in just one year.

#  How Iraqi YouTubers make money from slot machines

Iraqi YouTubers are making a killing from promoting slot machines. The popular YouTubers are getting paid to promote the machines in their videos, and the videos are proving wildly popular with Iraqi audiences. The YouTubers are making thousands of dollars for each video they produce, and the money is coming from the casinos themselves.

The casinos are paying the YouTubers to produce positive videos about their machines. The videos are then uploaded to YouTube, where they are watched by thousands of people. The casinos hope that the positive promotion will attract new customers, and it seems to be working. The videos have been viewed millions of times, and the casinos are making a fortune from the machines.

The Iraqi YouTubers say that they are happy to take the money from the casinos. They claim that the videos are just entertainment, and that they have no connection to the casinos themselves. But many people believe that the YouTubers are in league with the casinos, and that they are using their influence to promote gambling in Iraq.

Whatever the truth may be, it's clear that Iraqi YouTubers are making a lot of money from slot machines. And as long as there is money to be made, these YouTubers will continue to promote them.

#  Iraqi YouTubers make a fortune from slots

As the world becomes more and more digitized, traditional methods of making money are slowly becoming obsolete. One such industry that has been greatly affected is the gambling industry. Gambling used to be a business that was carried out in brick and mortar casinos, but with the advent of online casinos, it has now become a global industry.

One country where gambling is particularly popular is Iraq. And while there are many Iraqi businessmen who have made a fortune from casino gambling, none have done so as successfully as Iraqi YouTubers.

There are several Iraqi YouTubers who have made a fortune from slots, but the most successful of them all is Ahmad Al-Basheer. Al-Basheer started making YouTube videos about slots in early 2016 and since then his channel has grown to have over 1.3 million subscribers. What makes Al-Basheer’s channel so popular is the fact that he not only teaches people how to play slots, but he also shares his winning tips and strategies. As a result, many of his followers have managed to win big at online casinos.

In addition to Al-Basheer, there are several other Iraqi YouTubers who have also managed to make a fortune from slots. These include Hussein Al-Ameen, Ali Al-Dulaimi, Ahmed Mahdi, and Mustafa Abdulhussein. All of these YouTubers have thousands of subscribers and they continue to Upload new videos on a regular basis.

So why are Iraqi YouTubers so successful at playing slots? Well, one reason could be that they are familiar with the culture and language of online casinos. This familiarity allows them to easily navigate their way around casino websites and make quick decisions when it comes to placing bets. In addition, many of these YouTubers come from families who have a history of gambling. This gives them an advantage over other players who may not be as experienced or knowledgeable about the game.
