#  How Much Should You Tip Your Casino Bingo Attendant?

Casino bingo attendants can provide a variety of services to players, from answering questions to providing drinks and snacks. Tipping etiquette can be confusing, especially when it comes to casino employees. How much should you tip your casino bingo attendant?

Ideally, you should tip your casino bingo attendant based on the level of service they provide. If they go above and beyond, you may want to consider tipping them more than if they provided only basic service. The general rule of thumb is to tip between 10 and 15 percent of the total bill.

If you're not sure how much to tip, start with 10 percent and increase or decrease the amount depending on the quality of service received. You can also leave a tip in cash or place it in an envelope marked "Tip."

No matter how you choose to tip your casino bingo attendant, be sure to do so before leaving the premises. And don't forget to smile and say thank you!

#  Tips for Tipping Your Casino Bingo Attendant3. The Dos and Don'ts of Tipping your Casino Bingo Attendant4. How Much Should You Generally Tip Casino Employees?5. Are Tipping Guidelines Different for Casino Bingo Attendants?

If you're a regular player of casino bingo, it's likely that you'll want to show your appreciation to the attendant who helps keep the game running smoothly. But before you reach for your wallet, here are some tips on how and when to tip your casino bingo attendant, as well as how much is considered appropriate.

DO:

Tip your casino bingo attendant if they provide good service. If the attendant is helpful, informative, and keeps the game moving at a reasonable pace, a gratuity is definitely in order.

Tip according to the level of service received. If the attendant goes above and beyond, tipping a little more than the average is definitely warranted. On the other hand, if they don't do much more than what's expected, a smaller tip may be appropriate.

Tip in cash. Tipping in cash is always preferable so there's no confusion about the amount or who it's from.

DON'T:

Don't feel obligated to tip just because others are doing so. If you don't feel that the attendant provided good service, then don't tip them. There's no sense in tipping someone who didn't earn it.

Don't tip if you're dissatisfied with the service received. If you had an unpleasant experience with the attendant, it's best not to reward them with a tip. In fact, you may even want to speak to management about the situation.

How Much Should I Tip?

The conventional wisdom for tipping casino employees is to give 10-15% of the total bill for satisfactory service. So if you've won $100 playing bingo, then a $10-$15 tip would be appropriate. However, when it comes to tipping casino bingo attendants specifically, there aren't really any hard and fast rules. Some people tip based on whether or not they won or lost money, while others simply give whatever they feel is appropriate given the level of service received. It really all comes down to personal preference.
