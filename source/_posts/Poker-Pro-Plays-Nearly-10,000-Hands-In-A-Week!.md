#  Poker Pro Plays Nearly 10,000 Hands In A Week!

In what's being hailed as a new world record, a professional poker player has played nearly 10,000 hands in just one week!

The incredible feat was achieved by 26-year-old Patrick "MegaMoose" Leonard, who is no stranger to big numbers. Last year, he set the world record for most hands played in a day when he played 4,844 hands.

 Leonard is currently ranked #136 in the world and has over $1.5 million in career earnings. He started playing poker at the age of 16 and began grinding out long hours at the table soon after.

"I love the game," Leonard said in an interview with PokerNews. "I love the competition, the challenge, and I love winning."

It's safe to say that Leonard loves poker more than most people love anything. In fact, his only other hobby is sleeping – which he probably needs a lot of after this past week!

#  Are You Playing Enough Hands To Be A Specialist?

There are various opinions in poker circles about how often you should be playing hands. Some people advocate for playing a lot of hands, while others recommend playing a select few hands with a high degree of precision. What is the right approach for you?

If you’re just starting out, it’s generally recommended that you play more hands. This will give you more experience and help you to better understand the game. As you gain more experience, you can start to reduce the number of hands you play and focus on quality over quantity.

That said, there are some players who specialize in a particular area of the game, such as tournament play or cash games. If this is something that interests you, then it may be worth focusing on playing fewer hands, but with greater precision. This will allow you to develop a deeper understanding of the game and improve your skills in that particular area.

No matter what approach you take, always remember that poker is a game of patience and discipline. You won’t win every hand, but if you focus on making good decisions and playing smart poker, you’ll be successful in the long run.

#  How Many Hands Should You Play Per Day?

This is a question that a lot of poker players have and there is no easy answer. In general, the more hands you play, the better your results will be, but at what point does playing too many hands actually hurt your results?

The basic idea behind playing more hands is that the more hands you play, the better your odds of winning will be. This is due to two factors: first, you will see more cards, which gives you more information about the strength of your hand; and second, by playing more hands, you will put more money into the pot, which increases your chances of winning the hand.

However, there is a point where playing too many hands can actually hurt your results. This typically happens when you are playing in games where the average bet size is relatively small. In these games, if you are playing too many hands, you may end up losing money on bad calls or simply folding too often.

So how many hands should you play per day? The answer depends on a number of factors, including the size of the bets in the game, your skill level, and how comfortable you feel with making certain calls. In general, however, it is a good idea to start out by playing around 100-200 hands per day and then adjust as needed.

#  Playing More Than 1,500 Hands A Day - Is It Too Much?

The number of hands you play in a day is an important decision that poker players have to make. You want to get the most out of your time playing, but you don't want to overdo it and wear yourself out.

There are many different opinions on how many hands a day a player should play. Some people believe that you should only play around 100 hands per day, while others think that playing 1,500 hands is perfectly fine.

So, which is the right number for you?

Well, it really depends on your goals and on how comfortable you feel playing more hands. If your goal is to make money and you're comfortable playing more than 1,500 hands per day, then go for it! But if you're just looking to have some fun and don't want to grind quite as hard, then stick to playing fewer hands.

It's important to find a balance that works for you and makes you happy. Playing too many or too few hands can lead to frustration and burnout, so be sure to find a number that suits your lifestyle and goals.

#  Poker Pro Plays Just Over 6,000 Hands In A Month!

In early July, poker pro TonyBet announced that its sponsored player, Viacheslav "Slava" Buslov, played just over 6,000 hands in a month.

The Russian-born Buslov is one of the most successful players on the TonyBet Pro Team. In June, he achieved two final table finishes in tournaments at the Aspers Casino in London. The first was in the €75 buy-in Win The Button event, where he came in 4th for a €1,275 score. A few days later, he finished runner-up to eventual winner Mohsin Virani in the €220 buy-in Progressive KO Euro Special for a prize of €4,095.

Overall in his career, Slava has racked up nearly $600,000 in earnings. His live tournament winnings total almost $415,000 with cashes including a third-place finish at the 2017 PokerStars Caribbean Adventure (PCA) $25K High Roller for $244,580 and a runner-up spot to Scott Baumstein in the $25K SHR event at the 2018 WSOP for $314,522. Add his online tournament winnings and you get close to another million dollars!

When Buslov isn't playing tournaments he can often be found grinding cash games - both live and online - where he makes a good chunk of his income. Judging from his recent volume numbers it would seem that he's been doing quite well lately!
