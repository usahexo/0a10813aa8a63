#  Rewrite Your Luck on Tom Horn with PokerStars Casino

A recent study by the University of Cologne in Germany has shown that individuals who think and talk about good luck before playing poker are more successful than those who don't. Poker players at the casino can take advantage of this information by rewriting the way they think about luck while playing Tom Horn.

The researchers found that when people believed they were lucky, they were more likely to make correct decisions and get favourable outcomes in poker. The study showed that the simple act of talking to oneself or others about good luck before a game can change decision-making processes and increase the chance of winning.

To give yourself the best possible chance of winning at Tom Horn, you need to start thinking about luck in a new way. Instead of seeing luck as something that's out of your control, begin to think of it as something that you can positively influence through your thoughts and actions.
