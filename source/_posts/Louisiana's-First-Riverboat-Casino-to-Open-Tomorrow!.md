The boats will be allowed to operate on three waterways: the Mississippi River, the Ouachita River, and Lake Ponchartrain.

State Senator Ronnie Johns, who sponsored the bill in the Senate, said that it will create jobs and revenue for the state. “This is a major victory for Louisianans. This legislation is going to create new jobs and bring millions of dollars in revenue to our state,” said Johns.

Governor Edwards also praised the bill, calling it a “game changer” for Louisiana. “This legislation is a game changer for Louisiana. It will create jobs and economic development in areas throughout our state that need it most,” said Edwards.

The new law authorizes up to six casino boats to operate in Louisiana. Each boat will be allowed to have up to 500 passengers. The boats will be required to sail at least 25 miles from any land-based casino or racetrack. They will also be required to have a gaming license from the Louisiana Gaming Control Board.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased crime and gambling addiction. But supporters say that the new law will provide much-needed economic development to rural areas of the state.
